    <p>Since its founding in 1972, the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) is a world leader in expeditionary-scale geophysical research, conducting research in four broad themes: climate, energy, marine geosciences, seismology and tectonophysics, and planetary and polar geophysics. UTIG is home to more than 50 research scientists and postdocs — research entrepreneurs — providing a broadband of expertise that can do everything from conducting scientific ocean drilling to leading airborne radar studies of ice sheets. UTIG scientists supplement their fieldwork with computer analysis, modeling, and laboratory work. Whether collecting seismic data, responding to natural disasters, or searching space for signs of life, UTIG is there.</p>
<p>UTIG seeks state, national, and international opportunities to leverage its proven geophysical expertise to address leading issues in resource development and environmental management. When society faces critical environmental problems that cause controversy among citizens and confusion among government policymakers, UTIG scientists engage the parties, plan an appropriate and effective response, and collect the data that leads to responsible solutions. For such issues, UTIG scientists don’t take sides; they find answers.</p>
<p>about-page-planeStudents have always figured prominently in all aspects of UTIG’s research programs, including planning, data acquisition, data interpretation, and publication. UTIG scientists mentor students as they make the initial transition from learning to creating knowledge. This transition happens by leveraging knowledge learned in the classroom and field to solve some of the most outstanding geophysical questions of our time. Support staff at UTIG support student research with technical and administrative expertise.</p>
